# Happy Dummy

A tibia macro to train knights with Mad Sheep.</br>
Requirements :</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Knight lvl 10 to 15</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Sword of lvl 65+ (Your character must be 50 levels below the level required by the sword.)</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Before starting the bot, make sure your character is attacking mad sheep.</br>

NOTE:</br>
The bot only keeps its char online in the game by training, it makes light moves between 4 and 14 minutes.</br>
In case of server save, the bot does not initialize login and does not put the character to train. In that case YOU must do this manually.</br>
This is just a first version. I don't intend to create a bot for Hunts. The idea of ​​this bot is just to optimize online training.</br>
New updates will be made in order to improve the training system.</br>
